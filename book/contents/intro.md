# Floating and Submerged Structures

Welcome to this open, interactive book on Floating and Submerged Structures. This resource is an integral part of the Hydraulic and Offshore Structures (HOS) module B, offered within the [Master in Civil Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/ce/msc-civil-engineering) program at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft). The content not only serves this course but is also shared across other modules within the Civil Engineering and Geosciences master—and even extends into related programs such as Renewable Energies and Floating Wind in the Aerospace faculty.

## Scope

This online book is structured as a new Jupyter Book and is organized into the following main chapters:

1. **Introduction to Floating and Submerged Structures (FSS)**
2. **Environmental Source Characterization**
3. **Hydrostatic and Hydrodynamic Loads in FSS**
4. **Mooring Systems of FSS**
5. **Experimental Techniques in FSS**
6. **Modeling and Analysis of FSS**

## Authors

- **Oriol Colomés** – Assistant Professor in the Offshore Engineering section; Module Manager of HOSB3
- **Frank Lange** – Lecturer in the Offshore Engineering section; Main Instructor in HOS-B3
- **Shagun Agarwal** – Postdoctoral Researcher in the Offshore Engineering section; Instructor in HOS-B3
- **Sergio Sánchez** – Manager of the Structures MacroLab; Coordinator of FSS Mooring Lines Experiments
- **Gijs Oude Vrielink** – Teaching Assistant; Contributor to the development of this Notebook

## Acknowledgements

This book builds on the rich tradition of computational mechanics education and research at the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at TU Delft. We extend our gratitude to all who have contributed to and supported this ongoing endeavor in advancing the study of floating and submerged structures.
