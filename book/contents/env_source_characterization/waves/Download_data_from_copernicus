# Extracting data from Copernicus dataset

The following steps can be taken to extract environmental data at the location:

## 1. Download data from online dataset

1. Here you may pick one or two variables of interest. <br>
It is noted that more detailed ocean waves data can be found under a separate tab. <br>

We are interested in 

- **Significant height of wind waves**.
- **Significant height of total swell**
- **Peak wave period**
- **Significant height of combined wind waves and swell waves**


1. Choose one or several years. <br> 
For the statistical review it is important to have a number of years but the data which can be extracted is limited. <br> 
The choice here is to extract the years **2018**, **2019**, **2020** and **2021**. Next to this all year is chosen **January** etc. as well as all days.  <br>

1. For the time three hour values are chosen (to reduce the amount of data).  <br>

1. For Geographical area choose **Sub-region**. The longitude & latitude limits are given at the western and eastern side as well as Northern and Southern side. Data is extracted in the area between the values. <br>
