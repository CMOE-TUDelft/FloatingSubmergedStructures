# Hydro Loads

Floating and submerged structures are continuously exposed to a wide range of environmental and operational loads. These loads determine not only the structural design, but also the stability and life-cycle performance of the structure. This chapter addresses how those environmental and operational conditions translate into actual loads acting on the structure itself.

The loads acting on a structure in the marine environment can be broadly classified into:
- Self weight: the weight of the structure and all permanent components.
- Hydrostatic load: hydrostatic pressure, buoyancy and static floating stability.
- Hydrodynamic loads: forces due to water motion, such as waves, currents, and viscous flow effects.
- Mooring loads: forces arising from mooring lines, anchors, or floating mooring systems.
- Operational loads: loads related to equipment, payload, and functional use of the structure.
- Accidental loads: impacts, slamming, debris, collision or other unforeseen events.

The following sections provide detailed explanations of self weight, hydrostatic loads, and hydrodynamic loads, forming the core of hydro loads relevant for floating and submerged structures. Mooring loads are addressed separately in a dedicated chapter.  <!-- TODO Add a link for mooring chapter -->
