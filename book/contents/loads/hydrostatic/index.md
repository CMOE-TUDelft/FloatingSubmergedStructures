# Hydrostatic

We explore the hydrostatics of submerged cylindrical structures using a numerical approach. The goal is to understand how submerged bodies interact with fluid pressure fields and to calculate key parameters such as the forces acting on the body and its submerged depth (draft). This serves as a practical application of hydrostatics and numerical methods.

## Learning Objectives:
- Understand the interaction between submerged bodies and fluid pressure fields.
- Apply finite element concepts to model cylindrical structures.
- Use numerical methods to calculate forces and solve for equilibrium conditions.
- Visualize and interpret hydrostatic phenomena.
- This notebook provides a hands-on approach to learning hydrostatics and numerical modeling, making it an excellent tool for understanding the principles of fluid-structure interaction.
