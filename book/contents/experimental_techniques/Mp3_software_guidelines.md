# Mp3 Software Guidelines

This chapter gives a guiline how to use the Mp3 software. 

## How to install Mp3

## How to use Mp3
If everything is sep up on your computer, you only need to use the table shown in the figure below to read the forcing. Note that in Mp3, the channels are numbered starting from 0, so sensor 1 correspond to channel 0.

## How to calibrate the sensors with Mp3
To calibrate the sensors, follow these steps. At least three reference points are used to obtain a reliable calibration. 

Step 1: click right on the channel you want to calibrate and choose 'set zero'

Step 2: click tools and then calibrate

Step 3: choose your channel

Step 4: add a calibration point to this channel, here an example of a weight of 1 N is used

Step 5: if you have added your 3 reference points, click 'set channel'. The following note will appear

Click 'ok'and then click 'ready'. Repeat this process for all the sensors you plan to use. If you safe your configuration, Mp3 will remember the calibration factors, so the next time you work with the experiment, you won't need to calibrate again.
