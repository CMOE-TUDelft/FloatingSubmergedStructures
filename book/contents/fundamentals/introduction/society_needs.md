# Future Society Needs

In order to understand the future society needs, we have to focus on he global trends. The most important six are explained here, as taken from the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals)

## Governance
When looking at governance it involves global alignment on improving living standards, justice and rights, supported by the UN. A few important aspects are:
1. The United Nations sustainable development goals have been set up in 2015 to move the world forward by 2030. Progress was slow until 2019 but since then COVID19 and wars have impacted progress. Only seventeen per cent of SDGs targets are on track to be achieved, nearly half are showing minimal or moderate progress, and progress on over a third has stalled or even regressed. Situation is not getting better.
2. The approach to improve governance under the international order is a challenge, the Conference of the Parties (COP) on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change latest in Baku, this year in Belém in Brazil is experiencing headwinds. It is an issue that [ESG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_governance) considerations to assess companies, or alignment on Environmental, Social and Governance criteria is struggling in particular in the US at the moment. The following graphs from [Nathan Bullard](https://www.nathanielbullard.com/presentations
) show that it is positive to see that environmental aspects in companies are still strong.

3. [Illicit Economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illicit_trade) has a growing influence on governance. Deviant Globalization is the unsanctioned global flows of goods and services that violate bourgeois ethical sensibilities. Flows of human organs, drugs, weapons but also (sometimes state driven) cybercrime, money flows and take over of legal business/country. New developments include geocriminality (state driven use of criminal organisations). Since I looked at this aspect for the first time in 2008 it has grown considerably.

## Demography
The demography is one of the most important trends and is influenced by decreasing poverty and increasing wealth and has a strong impact on growing energy needs. UN Predictions indicate a growth to more than 10 billion people in 2100.

```

Next to this, aging and associated reduced working population effects the ability to increase GDP. Another trend, next to  climate change and demographics, are conflicts & disasters. These create increasing forced displacements, shown to be mostly driven by floods.

Increased greenhouse gas emissions are not yet reducing while the impact on the climate is evident. The example of the flooding last year in Valencia where in one day the same amount of rain fell as the previous three years is exemplary. We are entering a period in history where rolling a die no longer yields only a three or a six, but may now produce an eight or even a twelve. The range of possible outcomes has expanded, and as a result, the effects have become increasingly unpredictable.

## Energy Transition

The energy transition is one of the defining trends of our future. To counter climate change, we must shift our energy system from fossil fuels to renewable, sustainable solutions. This challenge is illustrated in three scenarios that show the end use of fossil fuels and the associated effects on CO₂ emissions. The ultimate objective is to achieve the Net Zero scenario, which offers the highest chance of limiting global warming to 2.0°C by 2100. This target was formalized during the COP conference in Paris (2015), with ambitions to go even further, towards 1.5°C.

In recent years, there has been a clear shift: after an initial period of emerging renewable energy, the focus moved to a broader energy transition. Following the Paris Agreement, the goal of Net Zero became even more comprehensive, influencing not just energy but also business transformation and industrial policy. This has increased the pressure on companies and governments to accelerate their transition. Electrification is the key development toward 2030, with the transition of hard-to-abate sectors crucial in the decades that follow.

### How is this Net-Zero transition going? Is it Hard or Easy? 
[Michael Liebreich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Liebreich) indicates it is hard among others because:
In spite of cheaper solar etc. the costs of the transition is huge. In particular for the developing countries.
The grid cannot cope with the electrification needed.
Rare earth metals are key in the development, and they can only be reached at often risk to the environment and social justice.

On the other hand it is Easy because among others:
Exponential growth of wind, solar, batteries etc. 
To be able to be important in the future the bigger powers are competing in this evolving industry

:::
::::  

The exponential growth is interesting to see and is a game changer.
These figures show the development of e.g. solar capacity since its introduction versus energy producers like nuclear or Gas. 
It shows that the development is at a decreased cost similar to WWII planes or the T-Ford. The development growth of renewable was 510 GW in 2023 and 700 GW in 2024. This could mean that we could reach a TW this year.

### Learning Rates and Impacts
One of the principal drivers behind the rapid decline in the cost of renewable energy technologies is the concept of the learning rate. The learning rate quantifies the average percentage reduction in cost that occurs with each doubling of cumulative installed capacity. As shown in the figure below, this phenomenon has led to remarkable cost declines in key clean energy sectors: approximately 30% for solar photovoltaics, 20% for wind power, 25% for batteries, and 19–20% for electrolysers. These steep learning curves have been instrumental in making renewable energy increasingly competitive with conventional fossil fuel sources.

```

The pace and direction of the global energy transition are currently shaped by a complex set of factors and evolving geopolitical, economic, and technological dynamics:

- **Geopolitical events:** The Russia-Ukraine war has not only disrupted economic growth, supply chains, and energy security, but has also served as a catalyst for accelerated transition efforts in Europe.
- **Trade barriers:** New policies such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) may strengthen the transition, while ongoing tariff conflicts can impede global progress.
- **Shifting resource dependencies:** The transition from fossil fuels to renewable technologies is increasing demand for rare earth minerals, altering the strategic significance of different countries in the supply chain.
- **Corporate priorities:** A renewed emphasis on shareholder value has led major oil companies to realign their development portfolios, generally constraining their renewable ambitions and resulting in greater homogeneity of strategy.
- **Natural gas markets:** Increased availability of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is expected to support energy systems for the next 10 to 15 years, providing both opportunities and challenges for decarbonization.
- **Technological demand:** The rapid growth of artificial intelligence and data centers—especially in the United States—is driving additional demand for electricity and further complicating decarbonization pathways.
- **Climate impacts:** Climate change itself is increasing energy demand, as illustrated by the clear relationship between rising temperatures and higher electricity consumption in countries such as India.

## Shifting World Order

A significant trend shaping global affairs is the decline of democracies and the rise of authoritarian regimes worldwide. From a European perspective, this development brings greater uncertainty to the rules-based international order and increases complexity in global alliances and trade. The global democracy index has fallen in recent years, with a growing share of the world’s population living under authoritarian or hybrid regimes. This shift poses challenges for international cooperation, human rights, and multilateral solutions to shared issues.

## Glocalization

A prominent emerging trend is glocalization—the strategic shift from globalization towards reinforcing regional and local autonomy. While globalization has brought significant benefits, recent years have highlighted the vulnerabilities it creates for security and self-determination. This has resulted in a renewed emphasis on local manufacturing, supply chain resilience, and infrastructure within political or economic blocs (such as the EU).

Key features of glocalization include:
- **Reshoring of strategic industries**: Increasing efforts to manufacture critical technologies and goods within national or regional borders.
- **Strengthening local infrastructure and connectivity**: Investments aimed at improving domestic supply chains and technological capabilities.
- **Reduction of internal barriers**: Especially within blocs like the European Union, to foster regional integration and resilience.
- **Strategic resource development**: Enhanced focus on local resource extraction and processing to reduce dependency on external actors.
