# Purpose of Mooring System Design

Different structures have vastly different demands. A temporary mooring for a supply ship has lighter requirements than a permanent mooring for an FPSO (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading). Understanding *why* you need a mooring is the first step to deciding *which* mooring approach fits.

A **mooring system** is defined as the complete setup of interconnected lines, connections, and anchor points between one (or several) floating and/or submerged body(-ies) and the seabed or other fixed points. Its main purposes include:

Often a mooring is used to connect a single floater to the seabed but sometimes it can be just the connection between two freely floating bodies. Key thought of this definition is to be aware that there can be multiple connections which should all be considered when designing a system. Reason is that they form an intricate dynamic system of masses and stiffnesses.  

1. Keep the bodies within a pre-defined area. Most likely these are areas in the waterline but thinking of a submerged structure it could also be a volume.  
2. Limit the motions. First order motions caused by waves on floaters, such as heave, roll, & pitch, are very difficult to restrain using a mooring system but the mooring can be used to restrain or take account of second order motions such as surge, sway or yaw.    
3. Limit the structural displacements within the bodies. In some cases an elongated structure under influence of wave loading can be designed with a mooring system to limit internal structural displacement such as in a submerged tunnel or pipeline.  

When designing a mooring system it is important to consider what you want to achieve. In most cases the mooring system is intended to keep a floating body within a certain area. As soon as the body moves out of this area the restoring forces increase to bring it back to its mean position. It achieves a stable equilibrium. 

This is what we could call a hardening system. But in designing, it is also sometimes an advantage to create a softening system, which limits the forces but allows more movement. Mooring systems can be designed to achieve this over a part of its excursions. 

The intent could be that the mooring lines should remain off the ground, which can be achieved through taut systems or through the use of intermediate buoys. 

One of the important functions for a mooring system is often the limiting of displacements due to the requirements on risers and/or electric cables. 

In the next session we will consider the following systems: The multi-line mooring system, the wishbone system and the tension leg system.
A body to body mooring is often a line system between vessels, which we will not work out further here.
