In this section, we introduce the fundamental ideas behind mooring systems. You will learn what mooring systems are, why they are used, and the different types of mooring configurations commonly employed in offshore structures. This provides the foundation for understanding their components, design considerations, and performance in later chapters.

From this section you will (hopefully) understand the components of a mooring system. Let's start on the next page!
