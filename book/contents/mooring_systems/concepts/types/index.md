# Types of Mooring Systems

- Moorings can be temporary or permanent. Temporary moorings are used for installation situations or in offshore oil & gas for short drilling periods. They do not need to be designed for the survival conditions.  
- Catenary  & Taut (spread) mooring. Most moorings are catenary moorings, consisting of several chain or steel wire lines. The taut mooring is a system where the mooring line exerts a vertical force on the anchor. Given that this is generally not allowed in catenary systems, it is only a special catenary mooring.   
- Single point mooring (also turrets). Although single point moorings are often still catenary moorings, the fact that there is a turret, around which the floating vessel can weathervane, reduces the load on the mooring.   
- Tension leg moorings. The tension leg platform is actually an extreme version of the taut mooring system. The high loads in the tension legs pull the floater down such that the system becomes an inverted pendulum.  
- Wish bone systems. In these systems the restoring force on the floater is caused by lifting a heavy (submerged or dry) weight. The weight is hung off from a central pile or platform, around which the floater can weathervane. 
- Intermediate moorings. These are the moorings between floating or submerged bodies.  
- Although it does not seem in place a Dynamic Positioning system on a floater does the same as a mooring system. It keeps a floater in position. This course will however not tackle this option further.
