# Taut

Taut Mooring systems:
Special situation of catenary mooring with vertical force on the anchor
Often chain / synthetic / chain combinations 
Follows same catenary formula as used in the situation of line on the seabed
Features:
Higher restoring stiffness
Larger tension fluctuations (effect on steel connectors)
Suitable in deeper waters
Best combined with driven piles (high vertical load capacity) but also with suction piles (NB: Connection with pile at around 70% of length in the seabed)


Wishbone system:
Water depth 150 m
Pile height above seabed 30 m
Length arm 30 m
Weight of ballast block 1000 T
Length wire connection 130 m

Characteristics:
Linear system 
In shallow water it provides additional flexibility
