# Analysis of mooring systems

In this chapter we will cover a number of aspects of offshore moorings:
1) We will discuss the catenary equation and its importance in designing mooring systems.  
2) Based on this  session you will be able to calculate an anchor line shape and understand how a force-excursion characteristic can be calculated as well as a complete system of mooring lines.  
3) The catenary equation we will discuss takes into account elasticity of the line, no external loads and no bending. There are two references we mention here which provide the theory and derivation of the equations.  

Time to calculate!
