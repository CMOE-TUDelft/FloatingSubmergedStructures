# Installation

This section provides an overview of the topic.

Methods for installation;
SSCV
Heavy lift vessels
Anchor handlers
Requirements;
Pre-lay space / corridor
Twist & snaking loss
Cut-to-length
Pre-tension / pre-stretching of synthetic wires
Chain links well laid out 
Hook-up systems

SSCV’s and Mono Hulls are used for mooring installation – here the Balder installing one of the Spar structures in the Gulf of Mexico
It shows the use of the Mooring Line Deployment Winch with a diameter of 10,5 m which reduces the sheathing pressure on the spiral strand wire and minimises contact pressure between layers of synthetic wires.

Heave lift vessels are also able to instal larger mooring arrangements shown here with the Jumbo vessels installing the Vito mooring in the GoM and Mero in Brazil. 
Note 1) the use of torpedo piles in Brazil. 2) The use of a cranemaster heave compensation unit.

Pre-lay corridor needs to be surveyed and free of material
During laying twist & snaking loss to be reduced by keeping tension while laying 
Once laid the position is checked and cut-to-length can be performed.
Pre-tension required to reduce snaking loss.
Mooring Chain Twist allowed 0.5 degrees per link and/ or maximum 10 degrees over any 20 links
Very good to lay out as shown. 
Connection systems these days do not require Mooring winches but connect direct to the vessel hull. 
In line Mooring tensioener and Pull in connectors are now used more frequently
Mooring Wire Twist 360 degrees per 1000 m. Maximum 90 degrees per 250 m
Mooring Wire MBR R = 1968 mm to centre line of wire
