# Mooring line costs

Looking at costs of a mooring system, there are a number of items to consider:
1.	The mooring equipment costs on a floating vessel. This can be the mooring winches and the fairleads. 
2.	Or the line can be directly connected to a vessel. But then the costs of the Pull-in connector with receptacle and male connector and load pin need to be considered as well as the system in one or more lines to tension up the lines such as the ILMT. 
3.	Transport costs
4.	Installation costs; depending on the method, the availability and the locations, this can range from over a million US $\$$ a day for a large installation vessel to 100,000 US $\$$ a day for anchor handlers. Key is to establish the durations involved in the installation and whether it includes weather downtime.
5.	Mooring material costs, which is given on the next sheet.

This is an overview of the material costs (indicative):
- Steel wire rope  ~ 70 US $\$$/m/MN (MBL)
- Chain costs 75 US $\$$/m/MN
- Polyester 25  $\$$/m/MN
- Connectors ~ US $\$$ 150k
- Suction piles ~  US $\$$ 3k / mt
- Steel piles ~ US $\$$ 1k /mt

If we use the values and try to establish an estimate on the 12-line multi component system shown in session three, this would be at least 30 million US $\$$ for material and at least the same for the installation. This would make at least 60 million US $\$$, excluding the transport and fixed mooring assets on the floater. It shows that establishing a cost-effective mooring on material and on installation methods is hugely important.
