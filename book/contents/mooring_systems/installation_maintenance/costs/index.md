Mooring system costs require review of:
Mooring equipment costs on a vessel;
Mooring winches
Mooring fairleads
Or connected to a vessel;
ILMT = In line mooring connector
PiC = Pull-in Connector – receptacle and male and load pin.
Transport costs
Installation costs
Range from using anchor handlers – SSCV; 0,1 – 1,3 million US$/day
Durations are based on type of vessel, material availability and preparatory work

## Assignment 1
Assignment is to establish the stiffness of a four-point mooring system of a floater.
Floater diameter 30 m with four fairleads at 15 m below waterline
Water depth = 100 meters

System consists of:
Assume studless chain Vicinay R4S 147 mm: Breakload 18852 kN, weight 376 kg/m, EA ~ 1850 MN, length 400 m 
Pretension ~ 500 kN

Question: What is the horizontal stiffness in the direction of one of the lines?

### Solution
Assignment is to establish the stiffness of a four-point mooring system of a floater.
Anchor separation to be checked to get correct pretension and assume only two lines act on the floater:
Take 730 m & 750 m as test distances between anchors;
Results:
Tension (730) = 427 kN
Tension (750) = 537 kN
Indication of 743 m -> 490 kN pretension
Stiffness ~ 100 kN / 4,5 m = 22 kN/m 


## Assignment 2
Assignment is to establish the stiffness of a four-point mooring system of a floater.
Floater diameter 30 m with four fairleads at 15 m below waterline
Water depth = 1000 meters

System consists of:
Studless ground chain Vicinay R4S 147 mm: Breakload 18852 kN, weight 376 kg/m, EA ~ 1725 MN, length 300 m 
Polyester section Bridon superline 254 mm: MBL 18639 kN, weight 10,9 kg/m, length 1425 m, EA ~ 13 * MBL = 242 MN
Topchain segment Vicinay R4S 147 mm: Breakload 18852 kN, weight 376 kg/m, EA ~ 1725 MN, length 60 m 
Pretension 750 kN

Question: What is the horizontal & vertical stiffness in the direction of one of the lines and at 45 degrees?

### Solution
Horizontal stiffness:
Assume a move of 1 m in x direction
Fx = tan((arcsin(𝑑𝑥/𝐿𝑜)) * To + Aw * ρ * g * 𝐿𝑜×[1−√((1)−(𝑑𝑥/𝐿𝑜)^2)]
 3* tan((arcsin(1/85)) * 1000 = 35 kN
It follows that Kx = 35 kN/m

Vertical stiffness:
Kz = Nt * At * E + Aw * ρ * g
Kz = 3 * 0,25 * 𝜋* 0,06^2 *1,1*1011 = 933 MN/m


# Assignment 3
Assignment is to establish the stiffness of a 3-line TLP mooring system of a floater.
Floater connection points 25 m at 120-degree angles with tendon connection at 15 m below waterline
Water depth = 100 meters
System consists of:
3 legs of 60 mm Steel wires tendons (Bridon sheathed Steel wire) MBL 3820 kN
Assume E = 1,1*1011 N/m2
Pretension 1000 kN

Question: What is the horizontal & vertical stiffness, ignoring set down?
