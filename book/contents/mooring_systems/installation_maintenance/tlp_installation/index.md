# Tension Leg Platform Installation methods;

Foundations:
Gravity based anchors – Snorre Concrete Foundation Templates
Single piles through templates (Hutton TLP)
Single pile direct placement (depends on soil conditions)

TLP tendons have been installed with gravity based anchors, single piles through templates but mor often with a single pile for each tendon.

Position: 	+/- 2 ft (any direction)
Verticality:	+/- 1 degree (any direction)
Elevation:	+/- 1 ft of desired position relative to seabed

There are a few examples of towed out tendons but as I have experienced personally this was not always very successful (Heidrun & Conoco Jolliet)
Most TLP’s have been connected to pre-installed tendons pre-installed with buoyancy tanks. 
Tendons are then preassembled by connecting segments with a mechanical (Merlin) connector (you can watch the video on how this connection takes place) and when finished placed in a pile with a parker tool.

Tension Leg Platform Installation methods;
TLP connection
Self-installing / free floating – stability during connection, own ballast system, at moment of lock-off ratcheting to be avoided. 
Crane assisted – keeping high GM value

Once the TLP is at location it can be self-installing or installed crane assisted. 
Ballasting down to achieve connection may make the unit unstable and requires accurate ballasting procedures. Big differences in waterplane area need to be avoided.
