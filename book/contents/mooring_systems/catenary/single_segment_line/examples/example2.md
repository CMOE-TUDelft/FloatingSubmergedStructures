# Example 2
Example (2) Calculation of a force-excursion characteristic with Fairlead attachment 820 m above seabed. 3 segment line: Chain/ Polyester / Chain:
Studless ground chain Vicinay R4S 147 mm: Breakload 18852 kN, weight 376 kg/m, EA ~ 1725 MN, length 300 m 
Polyester section Bridon Superline 254 mm: MBL 18639 kN, weight 10,9 kg/m, length 1425 m, EA ~ 13 * MBL = 242 MN
Topchain segment Vicinay R4S 147 mm: Breakload 18852 kN, weight 376 kg/m, EA ~ 1725 MN, length 60 m

Example shows:
Tension starts picking up once first 50 m of chain has lifted from the seabed
The stiffness of the system is fairly linear (semi-taut system)
Use of polyester in deeper water but also to linearize the system

```{dropdown} What is the stiffness?
Stiffness at pretension of 700 kN equals ~ 15 kN/m
```

Using example (2) a 12 line 3-segment system in deep water creates a force-excursion characteristic as shown below. Offset is from the mean position. Pretension in each line 700 kN

```

```

The resulting stiffness is (refer curve):
Kmooring = 1000 / 10 = 100 kN/m
(Which is slightly higher than 6 x 15 kN/m)
