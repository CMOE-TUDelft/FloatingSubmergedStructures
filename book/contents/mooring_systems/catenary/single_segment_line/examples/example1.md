# Example 1

Example (1) Calculation of a force-excursion characteristic with Fairlead attachment 200 m above seabed. Full chain line:  
 
Studless chain Vicinay R4S 147 mm, Breakload 18852 kN, weight 376 kg/m, EA ~ 1850 MN, length 600 m 

```{figure} ../../../../../figures/example1.png
```

Example shows:
Non-linear line behavior
High forces (full chain)
With larger excursions high tensions 

```{dropdown} What is the stiffness?
Stiffness at pretension of 1200 kN equals ~ 15 kN/m
```

Using example (1) In Multi-line mooring systems, the force-excursion characteristics of the single lines are combined in a total system and are dependent on the pretension in each line.

```

```{figure} ../../../../../figures/example1_2.png
```

The resulting stiffness is (refer curve):
Kmooring = 600 / 20 = 30 kN/m
