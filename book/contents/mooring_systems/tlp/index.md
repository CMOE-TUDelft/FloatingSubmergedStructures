# Tlp

Tension Leg Platform
Key characteristics:
Low (No) Heave
Limited excursions due to waves 
Sensitive to weight changes
Mooring principle applicable to other structures
Deep water structure

Given the theory for large TLP’s, in the application for Floating Offshore Wind there can be large differences:
Floater has limited waterplane area (limited set-down)
Submerged body attracts less wave and current load (e.g. space frame)
Shallower water depths – cover the range deeper than 50 meters which is beyond realm for bottom founded offshore structures.
Tendons or tethers can be inclined, which changes the stiffness modes considerably, but which can provide benefits to the tendon design.
There is no strong definition, but tendons are generally steel tubulars while tethers are steel wire or synthetic wire rope. This material is also more common for FOW. 
Installation of a TLP system is complicated and with structures which do not have self-floating capability it requires dedicated equipment.
