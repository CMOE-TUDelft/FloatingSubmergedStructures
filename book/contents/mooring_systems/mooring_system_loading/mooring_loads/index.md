# Mooring Loads

Based on this chapter you will understand the loads on a mooring system and how a design is performed. Some important considerations are given for the design of a mooring system.

Loads (actions) on a floating or submerged body can be classified as permanent, variable, environmental, or accidental.

````{dropdown} **Permanent / Variable Loads**  
  - **Hydrostatic loads:** Weight and buoyancy forces acting on the structure.  
  - **Ballast & variable weights:** Changes in mass distribution due to ballast adjustments, operational payloads, or other variable loads.  
````

````{dropdown} **Environmental Loads**  
  - **Wind loads:** Including gusts and squalls acting on exposed surfaces.  
  - **Current loads:** Steady or varying currents applying forces along the hull or mooring lines.  
  - **Wave loads:**  
    - First-order oscillatory forces.  
    - Second-order drift forces due to sum and difference frequencies.  
  - **Other phenomena:** Potential ice loads, solitons, or extreme environmental events.  
````

````{dropdown} **Accidental Loads**  
  - **Impact forces:** From ships, submarines, or other floating objects.  
  - **Accidental flooding/submergence:** Rapid changes in buoyancy or weight.  
  - **Loss of mooring line(s):** Sudden redistribution of forces on remaining lines.  
````

````{dropdown} **Response Characteristics**  
  - **Hydrostatic stiffness:** Restoring forces resulting from buoyancy and weight distribution.  
  - **Mooring stiffness and damping:** Resistance and energy dissipation provided by connected mooring lines, risers, or cables.
