# Anchors

Anchors form the fixed connection between a mooring line and the seabed, providing the necessary resistance to horizontal and, in some cases, vertical loads. In floating offshore systems, especially for Floating Offshore Wind (FOW), several anchor types are available, each with distinct installation methods, load capacities, and suitability depending on soil conditions and water depth.
