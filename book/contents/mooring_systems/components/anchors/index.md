# Anchors

Anchors form the fixed connection between a mooring line and the seabed, providing the necessary resistance to horizontal and, in some cases, vertical loads. In floating offshore systems, especially for Floating Offshore Wind (FOW), several anchor types are available, each with distinct installation methods, load capacities, and suitability depending on soil conditions and water depth.

## Overview of Anchor Types

:::{tab-item} Gravity (Clump Weight) Anchor
A gravity anchor, also known as a deadweight anchor, resists loads through its own submerged weight and the friction it generates with the seabed. It can be constructed from a concrete block or a steel container filled with heavy material such as stone.  

- **Capacity**: Dependent on mass and seabed friction; capable of handling both horizontal and vertical loads.  
- **Limitations**: Large weight requirements for high loads make installation and removal challenging.  
- **Usage**: Rare in modern offshore practice due to logistical constraints.

:::{tab-item} Driven Pile
Driven piles are widely used for permanent moorings in a broad range of soil conditions, offering high capacity in both horizontal and vertical directions.  

- **Design**: Diameters typically range from 2–5 m with length-to-diameter (L/D) ratios up to 60.  
- **Efficiency**: Horizontal and vertical force-over-mass ratios from 12–100, depending on soil.  
- **Installation**: Performed using pile driving (significant underwater noise impact) or vibration hammers (currently less feasible in deep water).  
- **Removal**: Requires cutting below the mudline; full extraction is impractical.  
- **Suitability**: Effective across a wide range of line angles.

:::{tab-item} Drag or Embedment Anchor
Drag embedment anchors are cost-effective and widely used in offshore applications, particularly in cohesive soils.  

- **Capacity**: High horizontal load capacity; for example, the Stevpris Mk5 (30 mT anchor) can provide ~1700 mT ultimate holding capacity in sand and hard clay.  
- **Efficiency**: Horizontal force-over-mass ratio from 30–300, depending on soil.  
- **Limitations**: Not suited for significant vertical loading; typically limited to pull angles ≤ 10° from the seabed.  
- **Installation**: Straightforward and easily reversible, although high-load installations may be limited by available bollard pull.
:::

:::{tab-item} Suction Pile
Suction piles are large-diameter, cylindrical anchors installed by pumping water out from inside the pile to create pressure-driven penetration into the seabed.  

- **Design**: Diameters generally < 16 m, with L/D < 1 in sand and up to ~8 in clay.  
- **Efficiency**: Horizontal ratio from 50–250; vertical ratio from 9–100 (vertical capacity highly soil-dependent).  
- **Advantages**: Low-noise installation, relatively easy removal.  
- **Limitations**: Not suitable for loose sand, stiff soils, or layered/competent formations such as over-consolidated clays, gravels, chalk, or weak rock.
:::

:::{tab-item} Torpedo Pile
Developed in Brazil, the torpedo pile is a free-fall anchor dropped from a height (e.g., 100 m) above the seabed, penetrating under its own kinetic energy.  

- **Capacity**: Provides both vertical and horizontal resistance in soft to medium clays.  
- **Advantages**: Simple deep-water installation.  
- **Limitations**: Holding capacity prediction is uncertain due to uncontrolled installation.
:::

:::{tab-item} Vertical Load Anchor (VLA)
The VLA is an evolution of the drag embedment anchor, designed to handle both horizontal and significant vertical loads, particularly in layered soft clays.  

- **Advantages**: Combines the ease of installation/removal of drag anchors with vertical load capability.  
- **Limitations**: Primarily suited to soft cohesive soils.
:::

:::{tab-item} Hybrid Solutions
In some cases, hybrid systems are developed, such as combining gravity anchors with suction units. For example, the Snorre Tension Leg Platform used concrete foundation suction units weighing 6000 mT — a unique, high-cost design.

Anchor choice for FOW applications depends on load requirements, soil conditions, installation feasibility, and removal considerations.  
- **Driven piles**: Flexible in soil type and capable across wide angle ranges; high noise during installation may be a constraint.  
- **Drag anchors**: Highly efficient in cohesive soils for horizontal loading; limited vertical capacity.  
- **Suction piles**: Favoured where vertical load capacity is needed and soil allows, with minimal noise and ease of removal.  
- **Torpedo piles**: Best for deep-water, soft clay environments where installation logistics favour gravity drop.  
- **VLAs**: Optimal in layered clays requiring both vertical and horizontal holding.
