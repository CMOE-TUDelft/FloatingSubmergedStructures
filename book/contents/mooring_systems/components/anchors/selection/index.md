Anchor choice for FOW applications depends on load requirements, soil conditions, installation feasibility, and removal considerations.  
- **Driven piles**: Flexible in soil type and capable across wide angle ranges; high noise during installation may be a constraint.  
- **Drag anchors**: Highly efficient in cohesive soils for horizontal loading; limited vertical capacity.  
- **Suction piles**: Favoured where vertical load capacity is needed and soil allows, with minimal noise and ease of removal.  
- **Torpedo piles**: Best for deep-water, soft clay environments where installation logistics favour gravity drop.  
- **VLAs**: Optimal in layered clays requiring both vertical and horizontal holding.
