# Chain Segment Types

Chains used in offshore mooring systems are typically either **studlink** or **studless**.  

A **studlink chain** contains a central cross-piece (stud) in each link. This stud:
- Increases the weight of the chain, which can improve catenary restoring force.
- Enhances link stiffness, reducing deformation and twisting.
- Improves strength and fatigue resistance.

A **studless chain** omits the stud, making it lighter and easier to handle. This reduced weight can be beneficial in weight-sensitive designs, especially for upper segments near the floater. However, studless chains are more prone to link deformation under high load.


Typically chains provide the connection from foundation to floater in certain segments. Lower segments often use heavy studlink chain for seabed contact and abrasion resistance, while upper segments may use studless chain to reduce weight and ease handling.
