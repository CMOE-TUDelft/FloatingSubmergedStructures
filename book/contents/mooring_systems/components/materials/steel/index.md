# Rope Segment Types

Mooring lines often include **rope segments** to reduce weight, improve compliance, and optimize cost. Two main categories are used in offshore applications:

## Steel Spiral Strand Wire Rope
Steel wire ropes are composed of multiple layers of helically twisted steel wires, often arranged to achieve **torque stability**. Coatings may be applied to improve corrosion resistance and fatigue life.  
- **Advantages**: High strength, established manufacturing standards, predictable stiffness.  
- **Disadvantages**: Heavy compared to synthetic ropes (especially in deep water), prone to corrosion, more expensive than synthetic alternatives (~\$75/m/MBL).
