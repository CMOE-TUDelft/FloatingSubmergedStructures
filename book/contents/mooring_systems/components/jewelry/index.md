# Jewelry

With Jewelry we refer to all connectors, attachments, or accessories needed to attach or connect mooring or segments of the mooring line.



| Component                  | Purpose | Image |
|-----------------------------|---------|-------|
| **Clump weights**           | Heavy weights attached to the line to increase restoring force, reduce line angles, or improve station-keeping by adding pretension. | [![](../../../../figures/clump_weight.jpg)](https://www.farinia.com/blog/clump-weights-oil-and-gas-mooring-systems) |
| **In-line tensioners**      | Devices installed along the mooring line to adjust or maintain the desired pretension and compensate for line elongation over time. | [![](../../../../figures/image18.png)](https://www.kongsberg.com/contentassets/ed91f5c1f6cf4532bd7a46455fa5f8f7/inline-tensioner_23.06.22.pdf) |
| **Load reduction devices**  | Specialized elements that absorb or limit peak dynamic loads in the mooring system, improving fatigue life and protecting the floater. | [![](../../../../figures/loadreductor.png)](https://exfinsoftware.com/case-studies/dublin-offshores-load-reduction-device/) |
| **Mid-line buoyancy elements** | Buoys attached along the mooring line to alter its profile, reduce seabed interaction, or modify restoring stiffness. | [![](../../../../figures/mooringbuoy.png)](https://www.marineinsight.com/marine-navigation/what-is-a-mooring-buoy/https://www.marineinsight.com/marine-navigation/what-is-a-mooring-buoy/) |
| **Pull-in Connector**       | Connectors used to attach the mooring line to the floater during installation and allow for easier retrieval or disconnection. | [![](../../../../figures/image19.jpg)](https://flint-tech.com/products/btc/) |
| **Intermediate line connectors** | Hardware used to join two different mooring line segments, often between chains, wires, or synthetic ropes. | [![](../../../../figures/image20.png)](https://acteon.com/solutions/business-lines/intermoor)|
| **Mooring winches**         | Deck-mounted or subsea devices used to install, adjust, or retrieve mooring lines by controlling line length and tension. | [![](../../../../figures/mooringwinch.jpg)](https://www.altradsparrows.com/offshore-energy/capability/experience/service-and-inspection-of-mooring-winch-hydraulic-system)|
| **Fairleads**               | Guide structures mounted on the floater to lead mooring lines from the deck machinery to the water, reducing abrasion and bending stresses. | [![](../../../../figures/mooring_fairlead.jpg)](https://www.joet.org/journal/view.php?viewtype=pubreader&number=3196)|
