Loads (actions) on a floating or submerged body can be classified as permanent, variable, environmental, or accidental.

````{dropdown} Permanent / Variable Loads
- **Hydrostatic loads:** Weight and buoyancy forces acting on the body.  
- **Ballast & variable weights:** Changes in mass distribution due to ballast adjustments or payload variations.
````
````{dropdown} Environmental Loads
- **Wind loads:** Including gusts and squalls acting on exposed surfaces.  
- **Current loads:** Steady or varying currents applying forces along the hull or mooring lines.  
- **Wave loads:**  
  - 1st order wave forces (oscillatory).  
  - 2nd order wave drift forces (slow-drift components).
````
````{dropdown} Accidental Loads
- **Impact forces:** From ships, submarines, or other floating objects.  
- **Accidental flooding/submergence:** Rapid changes in buoyancy or weight.  
- **Loss of mooring line(s):** Sudden redistribution of forces on remaining lines.
````
````{dropdown} Response Characteristics
- **Hydrostatic stiffness:** Restoring forces due to buoyancy and weight distribution.  
- **Mooring stiffness and damping:** Resistance and energy dissipation provided by mooring system.
