# Mooring Loads

Loads (actions) on a floating or submerged body;
Permanent / variable loads:
Hydrostatic loads [weight / buoyancy]
Ballast & variable weights
Environmental loads:
Wind loads (squalls)
Current loads
Wave loads (1st order wave forces / 2nd order wave drift)
Accidental loads:
Impact forces – ship/submarine
Accidental flooding/submergence
Loss of mooring line(s)
Response characteristics (Hydrostatic /mooring stiffness and damping)
